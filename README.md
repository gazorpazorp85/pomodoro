Pomodoro Timer!

This project was made with the new React v17!
All the state management and components lifecycles are handled with react hooks' useState and useEffect.
The css was handled with node-sass 4.14.1.
The idea for the design was taken from Frontend Mentor - https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pomodoro-app-KBFnycJ6G.
Since I don't have a premium account all the design was made without the sketch files.

Feel free to leave a comment about it, hope you'll enjoy it!
